# Faction Flow Society Engine

An early skeleton for a digital society simulator that unites citizens into factions through daily polls, communal scoring, and lore-infused analytics.

## Structure
- `frontend/` – Next.js plaza housing faction-facing components.
- `backend/` – Express gateway orchestrating poll, response, and faction summary routes.
- `db/` – Postgres tablets defining the core tables.
- `scripts/` – Analytics rituals run by the Midnight Assembly.

Each module embraces faction-flavored naming to keep the narrative spirit alive while leaving room for real integrations later on.
